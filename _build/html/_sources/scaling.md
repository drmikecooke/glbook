# Scaling the equations

We have two length scales:
```{math}
:label: lambda2
\frac1{\lambda_L^2}=8\pi K|\Psi|^2\left(\frac{e^*}{\hbar c}\right)^2
```

and $\xi=\sqrt{K/-a}$.

The magnetic field has associated the flux quantum $\phi_L=hc/e^*$ (determined almost by universal constants modulo the Cooper pairing theory) and the critical field $H_c=\sqrt{8\pi a^2/2b}$.

The four quantities $\lambda_L,\xi,\phi_L,H_c$ are likely objects that are easier to determine in experiment. The G-L free energy only contains three parameters, so one hopes the theoretical parameters can be associated with experiment. We also have $|\Psi|^2=-a/b$ in the uniformly superconducting state.

We can start by writing equation {eq}`lambda2` as:

$$\frac1{\lambda_L^2}=2 \xi^2H_c^2\left(\frac{2\pi}{\phi_L}\right)^2$$

This gives:

$$H_c=\frac{\phi_L}{\sqrt8\pi\xi\lambda_L}$$

The flux is the magnetic field over an area.
