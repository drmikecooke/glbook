```{admonition}  Using Live Code
:class: tip, dropdown
You can play with some of the code if you click on the rocket icon at the top and select "Live Code". You need to wait (a long time &sim;10minutes on first use in browser session) for the gray box that will appear above to report that the kernel is ready. The hidden code should run to initialize the page automatically, but may add some extra delay. The status of this process can be seen by clicking on the triangle next to "Show code cell content".
